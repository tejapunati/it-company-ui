# Authentication Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the authentication issues with the API.

## Problem

API calls were failing with 401 Unauthorized errors, preventing emails from being fetched from MongoDB.

## Solution

1. **Updated Auth Interceptor**
   - Added special handling for email endpoints to pass token as query parameter
   - Improved token handling for different types of endpoints

2. **Updated Email API Service**
   - Modified `getDirectEmailLogs` method to include token as query parameter
   - Modified `getEmailLogs` method to include token as query parameter
   - Modified `clearEmailLogs` method to include token as query parameter
   - Added direct token extraction from localStorage for reliability

## How It Works

1. For email-related endpoints, the token is passed as a query parameter (`?token=xxx`)
2. For other endpoints, the token is passed in the Authorization header
3. If the API call fails, the application falls back to sample data

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Check that real emails from MongoDB are displayed
4. Navigate to the email logs page to see all emails
5. Check the browser console for any remaining API errors
