# Backend Connection Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the connection to the backend API.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Auth Interceptor**
   - Added proper Content-Type and Accept headers to all API requests
   - Ensured JWT token is correctly included in authenticated requests
   - Improved handling of public vs. authenticated endpoints

## How It Works

1. The application makes API calls to fetch emails from MongoDB
2. The auth interceptor adds the JWT token and proper headers to authenticate requests
3. If the direct endpoint fails, it falls back to the standard endpoint
4. If both API endpoints fail, it falls back to sample data as a last resort

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Check that real emails from MongoDB are displayed
4. Navigate to the email logs page to see all emails

## Troubleshooting

If emails still don't appear:
1. Check the browser console for API errors
2. Verify that the JWT token is being sent correctly
3. Check that the MongoDB collections contain email data
4. Verify that the backend API endpoints are working correctly

## API Endpoints Used

- `/direct-emails/{email}` - Primary endpoint for fetching emails
- `/emails/{email}` - Fallback endpoint for fetching emails
- `/emails/{email}` (DELETE) - Endpoint for clearing emails
