# Email Display Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Token Duplication in Auth Interceptor**
   - Fixed the auth interceptor to prevent adding token twice to email endpoints
   - Added a check to only add token if it's not already present in the URL

2. **Removed Manual Token Handling in Email API Service**
   - Removed redundant token handling from `getEmailLogs`, `getDirectEmailLogs`, and `clearEmailLogs` methods
   - Let the auth interceptor handle token addition consistently

3. **Improved Email Data Processing**
   - Added try-catch blocks to handle errors during email data processing
   - Added fallback values for missing email properties
   - Added automatic fallback to sample data when no emails are found
   - Added proper error handling for date parsing

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by the token being added twice to email API requests:
1. First in the `email-api.service.ts` methods
2. Then again in the `auth.interceptor.ts`

This resulted in URLs like:
```
/api/v1/emails/user@example.com?token=xyz&token=xyz
```

Which caused authentication failures on the backend.

## Testing

The fixes have been implemented and should resolve the email display issues. The application now:
1. Properly authenticates email API requests
2. Falls back to sample data when API calls fail
3. Handles errors gracefully during email data processing
