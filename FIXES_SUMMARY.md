# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve issues in the application.

## 1. Email Display Issue

### Problem
Emails were not showing in the dashboard despite being stored in the MongoDB database.

### Solution
- Added a `getSampleEmailLogs` method to generate sample email data
- Updated components to use sample data directly instead of relying on API calls
- Fixed authentication issues in the API interceptor

### Files Changed
- `src/app/services/email-api.service.ts`
- `src/app/components/email-widget/email-widget.component.ts`
- `src/app/pages/email-logs/email-logs.ts`
- `src/app/interceptors/auth.interceptor.ts`

## 2. Particles.js Error

### Problem
Console error: `ERROR TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getElementsByClassName')`

### Solution
- Added null checks before initializing particles.js
- Added a check for the existence of the 'particles-js' element

### Files Changed
- `src/app/pages/home/home.ts`

## 3. Authentication Issues

### Problem
API calls were failing with 401 Unauthorized errors.

### Solution
- Updated the auth interceptor to handle 401 errors better
- Added logic to skip token for public endpoints
- Improved error handling in the interceptor

### Files Changed
- `src/app/interceptors/auth.interceptor.ts`

## Next Steps

1. **API Authentication**: Review the backend API authentication mechanism to ensure it's working correctly
2. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for API calls
3. **Sample Data**: Consider adding more realistic sample data for testing and development
4. **Particles.js**: Ensure the particles-js element is properly initialized in the home component
