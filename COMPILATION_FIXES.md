# Compilation Fixes

This document explains the fixes made to resolve compilation errors in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Email Logs Component Errors**
   - Fixed syntax error with extra closing brace
   - Added missing methods: `getEmailIcon`, `getEmailTypeLabel`
   - Made `emailsLoaded` property public so it can be accessed from the template
   - Added null check for email type in `mapEmailType` method
   - Removed duplicate method implementations

2. **User Dashboard RouterLink Warning**
   - Replaced `RouterLink` import with `RouterModule` in the imports array
   - Added proper import for `RouterModule`

## Files Modified

- `src/app/pages/email-logs/email-logs.ts`
- `src/app/layout/user-dashboard/user-dashboard.ts`

## How to Test

1. Run `ng serve` to start the application
2. Verify that there are no compilation errors
3. Navigate to the email logs page to ensure it displays correctly
4. Check the user dashboard to ensure the email widget is displayed properly

If you encounter any other issues, please check the browser console for errors and verify that all components are properly imported and configured.
