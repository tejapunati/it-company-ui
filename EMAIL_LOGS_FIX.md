# Email Logs Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the issue with emails not showing in the email logs dashboard.

## Problem

Emails were being stored in the MongoDB database but were not being displayed in the user, admin, and parent admin dashboards.

## Solution

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. Created a dedicated `EmailApiService` to handle API calls to fetch emails from the backend
2. Updated the `email-logs.ts` component to use the new service with better error handling
3. Created a reusable `EmailWidgetComponent` to display emails in dashboards
4. Updated the user and admin dashboards to use the new email widget component
5. Updated the environment configuration to use the correct API URL

## Files Changed

- `src/environments/environment.ts` - Updated API URL to use absolute URL
- `src/app/services/email-api.service.ts` - New service for email API calls
- `src/app/pages/email-logs/email-logs.ts` - Updated to use the new service
- `src/app/components/email-widget/email-widget.component.ts` - New reusable component
- `src/app/layout/user-dashboard/user-dashboard.html` - Added email widget
- `src/app/layout/user-dashboard/user-dashboard.ts` - Updated imports
- `src/app/pages/admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.html` - Added email widget
- `src/app/pages/admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.ts` - Updated imports
- `src/app/pages/admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard.css` - Updated styles

## How It Works

1. The `EmailApiService` provides methods to fetch emails from both the standard and direct endpoints
2. The `EmailWidgetComponent` displays recent emails in a compact format with a "View All" link
3. If one endpoint fails, the service automatically tries the other endpoint as a fallback
4. The email logs page and widget components process and display emails from all relevant collections

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the Angular application with `ng serve`
3. Log in as a user, admin, or parent admin
4. Check that emails are now displayed in the dashboard and email logs page

If emails are still not showing, check the browser console for any errors and verify that the backend API is returning the expected data.
