We need to fix the email addresses in the HTML template by escaping the @ symbol. Let's update the login.html file:

---

Fixing the @ symbols in email addresses by using HTML entity

---

Now run the Angular app again:

---

Starting the Angular application

---

The Angular app should now compile successfully. Here's what we fixed:

1. Changed the login form field placeholder from "Username" to "Email"
2. Updated the LoginRequest interface to use `email` instead of `username`
3. Updated the auth service to send `email` instead of `username` to the backend
4. Fixed the test credentials to match what the backend expects
5. Escaped the @ symbols in email addresses using HTML entity &#64;

Now you should be able to log in with:
- Email: admin@ssrmtech.com
- Password: password123
- Role: admin

The backend connection indicator should show "Backend Connected" in green, and the login should work properly now.

Login failed: Http failure response for http://localhost:8082/api/v1/auth/login: 403 OK

---

Let's check what's happening with the login request by examining the network traffic. Let's also check if there are any CORS issues or security configuration problems.

1. First, let's check if the backend is properly allowing POST requests to the login endpoint:

---

Testing the login endpoint with curl using the correct credentials

---

We're still getting a 403 Forbidden response. Let's check the security configuration in more detail:

---

Let's check the application.yml to see the CORS configuration:

---

Let's check the AuthController again to see if there's any issue with the mapping:

---

There's a potential issue with the URL mapping. The AuthController is mapped to `/api/v1/auth`, but the context path in application.yml is also set to `/api/v1`. This means the actual URL would be `/api/v1/api/v1/auth/login`, which is incorrect.

Let's fix the AuthController mapping:

---

Fixing the AuthController mapping to avoid duplication with the context path

---

Now let's restart the backend server to apply these changes:

---

Finding the backend process to stop it

---

Stopping the backend process

---

Now let's start the backend again:

---

Starting the backend application again

---

I see the issue in the logs. The security configuration is still not allowing access to the `/auth/login` endpoint. Let's fix the security configuration:

---

The security configuration still has `/api/v1/auth/**` instead of `/auth/**`. Let's update it:

---

Updating the security configuration to match the new controller mapping

---

Now let's check the UserController mapping to make sure it's consistent:

---

Let's update the UserController mapping as well:

---

Updating the UserController mapping to be consistent with other controllers

---

Now let's restart the backend server to apply these changes. You'll need to:

1. Stop the current backend process
2. Start it again with the Maven command

After restarting the backend, try logging in again with:
- Email: admin@ssrmtech.com
- Password: password123
- Role: admin

The login should work now because:
1. We fixed the controller mappings to avoid duplication with the context path
2. We updated the security configuration to match the new controller mappings
3. We made sure the UserController mapping is consistent with other controllers

---

✓
Backend Connection Successful!
Successfully authenticated with the backend server.  but not taking to admin dashboard

---

Let's check why the login is successful but not redirecting to the admin dashboard. We need to look at the routing configuration and the login component:

---

Now let's check the auth guard to see if it's blocking the admin dashboard:

---

Let's check the isAdmin method in the auth service:

---

Let's check the login component to see how it's handling the navigation:

---

The issue is likely with the role value. Let's check the response from the backend to see what role format it's returning. Let's also check the admin dashboard component:

---

Let's check the JwtResponse class in the backend to see what role format it's returning:

---

Let's check the User entity to see how roles are defined:

The issue is with the role format mismatch between the backend and frontend. Looking at the logs, the backend is authenticating users successfully, but the frontend isn't navigating to the admin dashboard.

Let's add some debugging to the login component to see what role is being returned from the backend:

---

Adding debugging to see the role format returned from the backend

---

Now let's also update the isAdmin and isParentAdmin methods in the auth service to handle both uppercase and lowercase role formats:

---

Updating the isAdmin and isParentAdmin methods to handle both uppercase and lowercase role formats

---

Let's also update the User interface in the database.models.ts file to handle the uppercase role format:

---

Updating the User interface to handle uppercase role formats

---

Let's also update the AuthResponse interface to match:

---

Updating the AuthResponse interface to handle uppercase role formats

---

These changes should fix the issue with the admin dashboard navigation. Here's what we've done:

1. Added debugging to the login component to see what role format is being returned from the backend
2. Updated the isAdmin and isParentAdmin methods in the auth service to handle both uppercase and lowercase role formats
3. Updated the User and AuthResponse interfaces to accept any string for the role property

The issue was that the backend is likely returning roles in uppercase format (like "ADMIN" or "PARENT_ADMIN"), but the frontend was expecting lowercase format (like "admin" or "parent-admin").

Now when you log in, the frontend will properly detect the admin role regardless of case and navigate to the admin dashboard.

---

next

---

Let's check if the login is working now. If you've tried logging in again and it's still not redirecting to the admin dashboard, let's check if there are any errors in the browser console.

Let's also check if the admin dashboard component is properly defined:

---

Let's check if there are any errors in the admin guard:

---

Adding more debugging to the AdminGuard

---

Let's also check if there's an issue with the JWT token handling. Let's look at the auth token filter in the backend:

---

Let's check the JwtUtils class:

---

Let's check the AuthService in the backend:

---

Let's check the Role enum:

---

yeah successfully taken to admin dashboard. when i tried to logout i can't

---

Let's fix the logout functionality. First, let's check how the logout is implemented in your Angular app:

---

Now let's check the auth service's logout method:

---

Let's check if the backend has a logout endpoint:

---

I see the issue. The backend doesn't have a logout endpoint, but the frontend is trying to call one. Let's fix this by:

1. Adding a logout endpoint to the backend
2. Updating the frontend logout method to handle the case when the backend endpoint doesn't exist

Let's start by adding the logout endpoint to the backend:

---

Adding a logout endpoint to the AuthController

---

Now let's update the frontend logout method to be more robust:

---

Improving the logout method in the auth service to handle errors better

---

Let's also update the header component to use the router for navigation after logout instead of directly manipulating the window.location:

---

Improving the logout method in the header component to use the router

---

These changes should fix the logout functionality:

1. We added a logout endpoint to the backend AuthController
2. We improved the logout method in the auth service to:
   - Clear local storage first before making the API call
   - Reset the user subject immediately
   - Handle API call failures gracefully
3. We improved the logout method in the header component to:
   - Add console logging for debugging
   - Use a small timeout to ensure logout completes before navigation

Now when you click the logout button, it should:
1. Clear your local storage immediately
2. Reset the authentication state
3. Call the backend logout endpoint (which now exists)
4. Navigate to the home page

---

i opened local host in edge and chrome. i logined admin in edge and user in chrome. i submited time sheet but in edge admin dashboard i can't see any time sheet and email logs

---

Let's check the timesheet functionality to see why submitted timesheets aren't showing up in the admin dashboard.

First, let's look at the timesheet controller in the backend:

---

Now let's check the timesheet service:

---

Now let's check the admin dashboard component that should display the timesheets:

---

Let's check the data service that's used to fetch timesheets:

---

Let's check the user dashboard component where timesheets are submitted:

---

Let's check the email service:

---

Now I understand the issue. The problem is that the timesheets and email logs are stored in memory (in the email service and data service) rather than in localStorage. When you submit a timesheet in one browser, it's not visible in the other browser because:

1. The `emailQueue` in the EmailService is stored in memory, not in localStorage
2. The admin dashboard is looking for timesheets in localStorage, but they're not being properly saved there

Let's fix this by updating the email service to store emails in localStorage:

---

Let's fix the email service to store emails in localStorage:

---

Updating the constructor to load emails from localStorage

---

Now let's update the sendEmail method to save emails to localStorage:

---

Updating the sendEmail method to save emails to localStorage

---

Now let's update the TimesheetsComponent to properly load timesheets from localStorage:

---

Improving the loadTimesheets method to better handle localStorage data

---

Let's also update the email logs component to properly load emails from localStorage:

---

Updating the clearLogs method to also clear localStorage

---

check ng build

---

Let's check if there are any build issues with the Angular application:

---

Running ng build to check for compilation errors

---

There are several build errors that need to be fixed:

1. First, let's fix the email service issues:

---

Let's fix the email service:

---

Fixing the email service syntax errors

---

Now let's fix the timesheets component:

---

Updating the Timesheet interface to match the sample data

---

Now let's run the build again to see if we've fixed the issues:

---

Running ng build again to check if the errors are fixed

---

We still have an issue with the timesheets component. Let's fix that:

---

Let's fix the timesheets component:

---

Fixing the sample timesheets to match the Timesheet interface

---

Let's run the build again:

---

Running ng build again to check if the errors are fixed

---

Great! The build is now successful. Let's summarize what we fixed:

1. Fixed the email service:
   - Fixed a syntax error in the constructor
   - Added code to load emails from localStorage

2. Updated the Timesheet interface:
   - Made fields optional with `?` syntax
   - Added new fields for user-submitted timesheets

3. Fixed the timesheets component:
   - Added proper type annotation for sample timesheets

These changes should fix the issues with timesheets and email logs not showing up across different browsers. Now when a user submits a timesheet in one browser, it will be saved to localStorage and will be visible in the admin dashboard in another browser.

To test this:
1. Open the app in Chrome and log in as a user
2. Submit a timesheet
3. Open the app in Edge and log in as an admin
4. Check the admin dashboard to see the submitted timesheet

---

lets create a databse and store all data over there. and evry functionality need to work from registraion, lgin , timesheets,email logs, user approval, admin approvals, every thing . i need evry functionality need to work. because i want to deploy this total project in go daddy to my domain

---

To create a database and make all functionality work with persistent storage, we'll need to:

1. Set up a backend database
2. Update the backend API to use this database
3. Update the frontend to connect to the backend API

Let's start with the backend database setup:

---

Currently, the backend is using an in-memory H2 database. Let's update it to use MySQL for persistence:

---

Updating application.yml to use MySQL instead of H2

---

Now, let's update the pom.xml to include MySQL dependency:

---

The MySQL dependency is already included in the pom.xml.

Now, let's create a production configuration file for deployment:

---

Creating a production configuration file for deployment

---

Now, let's create a Dockerfile for containerizing the application:

---

Creating a Dockerfile for containerizing the backend application

---

Now, let's create a docker-compose.yml file for easy deployment:
