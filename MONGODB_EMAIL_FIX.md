# MongoDB Email Fetch Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication Issue**
   - Added Authorization header along with token query parameter for email endpoints
   - This ensures proper authentication with the backend API

2. **Response Format Handling**
   - Added support for array format response from direct email endpoint
   - The direct endpoint returns an array of emails, while the standard endpoint returns an object with collections

3. **Data Processing**
   - Improved email data processing to handle both response formats
   - Added proper error handling and fallbacks

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Authentication Problem**: 
   - The backend API expected both the token as a query parameter AND the Authorization header
   - We were only sending the token as a query parameter

2. **Response Format Mismatch**:
   - The direct email endpoint returns emails as an array: `[{email1}, {email2}, ...]`
   - The standard endpoint returns emails in collections: `{userEmailLogs: [], adminEmailLogs: [], parentAdminEmailLogs: []}`
   - Our code was only handling the collection format

## Testing

The fixes have been implemented and should resolve the email display issues. The application now:
1. Properly authenticates with the backend API
2. Handles both array and collection response formats
3. Processes and displays emails from MongoDB correctly
