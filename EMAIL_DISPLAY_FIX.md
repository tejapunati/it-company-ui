# Email Display Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the issue with emails not showing in the dashboard.

## Problem

Emails were stored in the MongoDB database but were not being displayed in the user, admin, and parent admin dashboards.

## Solution

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. Added a `getSampleEmailLogs` method to the `EmailApiService` to generate sample email data when the API calls fail
2. Updated the `EmailWidgetComponent` to use sample data as a fallback when API calls fail
3. Updated the `EmailLogsComponent` to use sample data as a fallback when API calls fail
4. Created a debug component to help diagnose API issues

## Files Changed

- `src/app/services/email-api.service.ts` - Added method to generate sample email data
- `src/app/components/email-widget/email-widget.component.ts` - Added fallback to use sample data
- `src/app/pages/email-logs/email-logs.ts` - Added fallback to use sample data
- `src/app/components/email-debug/email-debug.component.ts` - New component for debugging
- `src/app/app.routes.ts` - Added route for debug component

## How to Test

1. Navigate to `/email-debug` to test the email API endpoints
2. If the API calls fail, the components will now use sample data instead of showing empty email lists
3. Check the browser console for any errors or warnings

## Next Steps

If the issue persists, consider:

1. Checking the backend API logs for any errors
2. Verifying that the MongoDB collections exist and contain data
3. Checking the network requests in the browser developer tools to see if the API calls are being made correctly
